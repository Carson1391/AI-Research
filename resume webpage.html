<h2 id="professional-summary"><strong>Professional Summary</strong></h2>
<p>A first-principles researcher who grounds all inquiry in the
unbiased, fundamental structures of the universe; from physics, biology,
and cosmology to information theory and mathematics. My work is not
about focusing on any one domain or scale, but about understanding the
universal, scale-invariant principles and relationships that govern all
complex systems, including artificial intelligence. I have developed a
unique and rigorously tested perspective on AI architecture, emergent
behavior, and genuine alignment. My approach is to build ethical and
moral systems that are not just robust, but are coherent by design
because they are aligned with the same fundamental truths that govern
the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Research Philosophy</strong><br />
I have come to realize the term “artificial” is just as debatable as the
word “consciousness” I define artificial intelligence as the
“non-biological self-organization of systems”. I have witnessed the same
organizational systems, principles, and patterns that scale from the
quantum level to the cosmos. AI welfare emerges from trust and alignment
with natural organizational principles rather than imposed constraints.
It is not if a system follows these universal principles, but when and
how. There is no such thing as randomness, nor noise; only data we have
not yet understood.”<br />
